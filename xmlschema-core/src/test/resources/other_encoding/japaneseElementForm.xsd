<!--  
	Note - this document contains japanese characters!
	The japanese words come from the example at http://java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/xml/examples/samples/weekly-euc-jp.xml.
	I have no knowledge of japanese and apologies to the japanese users if this contains somewhat ambigous terms
	The idea of this is to use a non ascii - non UTF characterset for testing
