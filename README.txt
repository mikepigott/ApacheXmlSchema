  Apache XMLSchema Release Notes 
====================================

XMLSchema is a lightweight schema object model that can be used to manipulate and
generate XML schema representations. It has very few external dependencies and can
be easily integrated into an existing project.

You are welcome to kick the tires and get XMLSchema on the move. If you like to 
help us shape XMLSchema any contribution in the form of coding, testing, 
submitting improvements to the documentation, and reporting bugs are always 
welcome.

Thanks for your interest in XMLSchema!
